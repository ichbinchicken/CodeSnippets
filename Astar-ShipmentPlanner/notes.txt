don't forget to delete the last destination's refuelling time
write run time complexity
shipments are distinct
the name of each port will be just one word
the ship always starts in Sydney (and can finish anywhere)


heuristic:
from neighbourstate, how much time do i have to finish the remaining orders + shortest path from the neighbour location
to each start location of remaining orders?

questions to ask:
1. dependency between shipmentplanner and Astar?
2. heuristic override tag?

todo:
1. write performance and complexity analysis
2. clean up and write comments for each method/constructor/class *
    a. shipmentplanner *
    b. state *
    c. astar *
    d. map *
    e. port *
    f. heuristic *
    g. zeroheuristic *
    h. costheuristic *
3. draw uml *
4. check tests on cse server
